# FLASH: A Fast and Reliable Shapley Value Approximation Framework for Model-Agnostic Interpretation

This repository contains the code for the paper "FLASH: A Fast and Reliable Shapley Value Approximation Framework for Model-Agnostic Interpretation".


## FLASH Overview
FLASH is a framework supporting model-agnostic interpretation via fast and reliable Shapley value approximation. FLASH employs a two-phase evaluation process. First, FLASH performs layer-wise evaluation to generate unique coalitions in a pattern growth manner. Second, FLASH conducts feature-wise evaluation to focus on the top-ùëò features with the highest evaluation variances. Moreover, FLASH balances the trade-off between evaluation efficiency and effectiveness by dynamically updating the allocation of coalition evaluations in the two phases, leading to more efficient and reliable Shapley value approximation.

# FLASH: A Fast and Reliable Shapley Value Approximation Framework for Model-Agnostic Interpretation

This repository contains the code for the paper "FLASH: A Fast and Reliable Shapley Value Approximation Framework for Model-Agnostic Interpretation".


## FLASH Overview
FLASH is a framework supporting model-agnostic interpretation via fast and reliable Shapley value approximation. It employs a two-phase evaluation process: first, a layer-wise evaluation to generate unique coalitions in a pattern growth manner, followed by a feature-wise evaluation that focuses on the top-ùëò features with the highest variances. FLASH also dynamically allocates the number of evaluations, ensuring a more efficient and reliable Shapley value approximation.

## Features
- Model-agnostic 
- Local interpretation
- Dynamic Allocation

  
## Implementation
1. ÂÖãÈöÜ‰ªìÂ∫ìÔºö
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

## Baseline Setup
- MC: The Monte Carlo method (MC) approximates the Shapley value by randomly sampling permutations of features. In the experiments, MC serves as a benchmark for approximating the Shapley value.
- CC: It reformulates Shapley value estimation by using complementary contributions, measuring the utility difference between a coalition and its complement. <[CC-Method](https://github.com/ZJU-DIVER/ShapleyValueApproximation)>
- CCN: Building on the CC method, CCN optimizes the sampling process using Neyman allocation. <[CCN-Method](https://github.com/ZJU-DIVER/ShapleyValueApproximation)>
- S-SVARM: It is designed to approximate the Shapley value by sampling coalitions without relying on marginal contributions. <[S-SVARM method](https://github.com//kolpaczki//Approximating-the-Shapley-Value-without-Marginal-Contributions)>
